# Google-Stock-Predictor
Using keras and various other python libraries such as, numpy, etc. I was able to create a RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)
stock predicator for the Google stocks 
based on its opening price. The training data set starts from March 3rd, 2012 to December 30th, 2016. 
My test data starts from January 3rd, 2017 to January 31st, 2017.
It is not as accurate as I want it to be, which is why it still needs work, however, it is able to give rough ideas about what is going to come in the future.
